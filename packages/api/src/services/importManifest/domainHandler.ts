/**
 * Manifest Domain Handler — shared interface + supporting types.
 *
 * The contract every domain handler implements. Each of the 8 declared
 * domains (`habitatSettings`, `columns`, `missions`, `tasks`, `subtasks`,
 * `dependencies`, `comments`, `templates`) ships its own handler module in
 * `./domainHandlers/<name>.ts`; this module defines the interface they share.
 *
 * # The four phases
 *
 *   - {@link DomainHandler.validate} — PURE. Reports ALL independently
 *     discoverable shape + reference-shape failures (accumulate, never
 *     first-error). Returns either the validated domain or the accumulated
 *     error list.
 *   - {@link DomainHandler.prepare} — PURE (no DB writes). Allocates
 *     prospective server IDs into the {@link IdentityMap} and produces the
 *     prepared-domain object. IDEMPOTENT: re-running with the same input +
 *     idMap reuses already-allocated server IDs (M4's preflight may re-run
 *     under contention).
 *   - {@link DomainHandler.resolveReferences} — PURE. Re-walks the prepared
 *     graph against the now-complete {@link IdentityMap}; rewrites sourceIds
 *     → server IDs; accumulates unresolved-reference errors. IDEMPOTENT.
 *   - {@link DomainHandler.apply} — T10B's tx-side write. Receives the
 *     caller-owned {@link TaskPublicationDbClient} (the tx client) + an
 *     {@link ApplyContext}; writes the per-domain rows. NEVER calls
 *     `getDb()`; never opens its own transaction; never emits effects.
 *
 * # Purity contract (load-bearing for validate / prepare / resolveReferences)
 *
 * Handlers are PURE functions of `(envelope, ctx, idMap)`. They perform NO
 * `getDb()` calls, NO `db.transaction`, NO inserts/updates/deletes during
 * the three pure phases. The M4 orchestrator drives them in sequence
 * (parents before dependents); T10B's `publishImportAggregateWithClient`
 * consumes the resolved prepared domains inside its own transaction. The
 * fourth phase (`apply`) is the one DB-writing phase — it lives inside the
 * caller's transaction.
 *
 * # Handler isolation
 *
 * Each handler validates ONLY its own domain's shape + its own domain's
 * direct reference SHAPE (e.g. a mission's `dependsOnSourceIds` are
 * well-formed sourceIds). Cross-domain GRAPH validation (cycle detection)
 * belongs in the `dependencies` handler; cross-domain reference RESOLUTION
 * ordering (columns before missions before tasks) belongs in the M4
 * orchestrator.
 *
 * @see packages/api/src/services/importManifest/types.ts for the manifest v3
 *      portable shapes each handler validates.
 * @see packages/api/src/services/importManifest/domainHandlers/ for the 8
 *      handler implementations.
 * @see T10A M3 ticket § "Scope" for the per-handler responsibility matrix.
 * @see T10B M1 ticket § "Scope" for the `apply` extension.

 * Allocates a prospective server ID for `sourceId` in the idMap, IDEMPOTENTLY.

 * If `idMap.sourceToServer` already has an entry for `sourceId`, returns the
 * existing server ID (the re-run case — M4's preflight may invoke prepare
 * twice under contention). Otherwise allocates a fresh UUID (or honors the
 * `restoreServerId` override), stores it, and returns it.
 *
 * # Why idempotent (load-bearing)
 *
 * The M4 preflight may re-run a handler's `prepare` phase (e.g. after a
 * transient contention retry). If `prepare` allocated FRESH UUIDs on each
 * invocation, the idMap would accumulate stale entries and the
 * resolveReferences phase would rewrite sourceIds to DIFFERENT server IDs on
 * each re-run — breaking the T10B apply phase (which consumes the resolved
 * prepared domain). Idempotent allocation keeps the idMap stable across
 * re-runs.
 *
 * # `restoreServerId` (F5 — restore identity preservation)
 *
 * For `identityPolicy:"restore"`, the sourceId IS the existing entity's
 * serverId (same-lineage proof verified at preflight). The handler's
 * `prepare` looks up the existing entity's serverId from
 * {@link ManifestContext.existingHabitatSnapshot} + passes it here as
 * `restoreServerId`. The idMap then maps `sourceId → existingServerId` (NOT
 * `sourceId → freshUUID`). The in-tx apply writes the existing serverId
 * back to the row (idempotent re-publish over the existing entity). Silent
 * remapping (the defect class F5 closes) is impossible — the override is
 * explicit + the idMap entry matches the existing row's PK.
 *
 * When `restoreServerId` is omitted (the default — `identityPolicy:"remap"`
 * OR the handler doesn't have an existing-entity match), behavior is
 * unchanged: a fresh UUID is allocated.
 *
 * # Idempotency interaction with `restoreServerId`
 *
 * If `idMap.sourceToServer` already has `sourceId` mapped (a re-run), the
 * existing entry is returned EVEN IF `restoreServerId` differs. This is
 * correct because: (a) the first call's mapping is authoritative; (b) for
 * restore, the first call would have used the correct `restoreServerId`
 * (the same snapshot is threaded through both calls). A divergent
 * `restoreServerId` on re-run indicates a snapshot inconsistency
 * (defensive — surfaces as a noisy mismatch downstream, not a silent
 * remapping).
