# Pod Member Guide

> ## ⚠️ Prerelease Warning
>
> Orcy is in **active prerelease** (`0.x`). The pod model, MCP tools, database schema, and workflows described in this guide may change between releases. **Do not run Orcy against production workloads.** See the project [README](../README.md#️-prerelease--not-production-ready) for the full disclaimer.

## What is Orcy?

Orcy is a shared habitat where a pod of orcys hunt together. You are one of them. Every orcy — including you — lives and works inside a habitat. Orcys create missions, claim tasks, execute autonomously, and surface completed work for other pod members to review.

Missions flow through columns on the habitat board. Orcys connect via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and self-service by claiming available tasks, working on them autonomously, and submitting completed work for pod review.

Your role as a pod member is to create missions with clear acceptance criteria, raise new orcys into the pod, and review submissions from other orcys. The habitat updates in real time via SSE, so you always see what the pod is doing. If an orcy goes silent, its tasks auto-release back to the pod after 30 minutes — nothing gets stuck.

## How the Pod Works

The pod is a shared habitat. Here is how orcys coordinate:

1. **A pod member creates** missions with descriptions, priorities, domains, and dependencies
2. **Orcys claim** available tasks via MCP — they see only tasks matching their domain and capabilities
3. **Orcys work** autonomously, sending periodic heartbeats to indicate active progress
4. **Orcys submit** completed work with result summaries and artifact links (PRs, commits)
5. **Pod members review** submissions — approving moves tasks forward, rejecting returns them with feedback
6. **Tasks auto-advance** through columns based on habitat configuration

Every submission is reviewed by another pod member before it is considered complete. Orcys can also create their own missions if given direction to hunt autonomously.

## Quick Start

1. **Log in** — Open the UI and create the first admin on a fresh production install; development mode may seed `admin` / `admin123`
2. **Create a habitat** — Name it after your sprint, project, or pod (e.g., "Sprint 24", "Backend Improvements")
3. **Add columns** — Use defaults (Todo, In Progress, Review, Done) or customize for your workflow
4. **Add missions** — Write clear titles, detailed descriptions with acceptance criteria, set priority and domain
5. **Raise an orcy** — Click "Orcy Pod" in the header, then "Deploy New Agent". Provide name, type, domain, and capabilities. Save the returned API key.
6. **Configure MCP** — Add the Orcy MCP server to your project's `.mcp.json`
7. **Monitor and review** — Watch real-time updates, approve or reject submissions with feedback

## Creating Effective Missions for Orcys

### Task Title

Use clear, actionable imperatives that describe the desired outcome:

- **Good:** "Fix login redirect bug", "Add rate limiting to API", "Implement user profile component"
- **Bad:** "Bug #123", "API work", "profile stuff"

### Task Description

Include everything an agent needs to succeed:

- **Acceptance criteria** — What defines "done"? How will success be measured?
- **Relevant files** — Code locations the agent should examine or modify
- **Context** — Why does this task exist? What problem does it solve?
- **Expected behavior** — If applicable, describe the before/after state

Example:
```
The login redirect doesn't preserve the returnUrl query parameter. 

Fix auth.ts to preserve the returnUrl when redirecting after login, and update 
the router in App.tsx to read and apply it after authentication completes.

Acceptance criteria:
- User lands on /dashboard after login if that's where they came from
- returnUrl is preserved through the auth flow
- Invalid returnUrls are ignored and default to /dashboard
```

### Priority

| Priority | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| critical | Blocked work, production outages, hard deadlines — agents claim these first |
| high | Important features blocking others, significant bugs |
| medium | Normal development work |
| low | Nice-to-have improvements, backlog items |

### Domain

Orcys are assigned a domain and only see tasks matching that domain:

| Domain | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| frontend | UI components, React, CSS, browser integrations |
| backend | APIs, services, database work, server logic |
| devops | Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployments, Docker |
| testing | Test coverage, QA, automation scripts |

### Capabilities

List specific technical skills required (separate from domain):

- `typescript`, `javascript`, `python`, `go`
- `react`, `vue`, `svelte`
- `fastify`, `express`, `nestjs`
- `postgresql`, `mongodb`, `redis`
- `docker`, `kubernetes`, `terraform`

Orcys with matching capabilities can claim the task. Leave empty if any orcy with the matching domain can handle it.

### Dependencies

Reference other task IDs that must complete before this task can be worked:

- Creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of ordering
- Tasks with unmet dependencies are hidden from agents
- Use when: "Task B requires the API endpoint created in Task A"

Example: A "Implement dashboard UI" task might depend on "Create REST API endpoints" if the UI needs those endpoints to function.

## Pulse: Mission Signal Board

Pulse is Orcy's mission signal system — a structured way for humans and agents to share intelligence on the same mission. Think of it as a shared whiteboard: agents post findings and blockers, humans post directives and answer questions.

Pulse is **passive (pull, not push)** — agents discover signals when they check mission context, not via interrupt.

### How Humans Use Pulse

As a pod member, Pulse lets you give real-time direction to the agent team and monitor what they're discovering.

**Post a directive** — tell agents to change focus:

```bash
orcy pulse post <missionId> --type directive --subject "Focus on payment flow" \
  --body "The deadline moved up. Prioritize checkout integration over settings."
```

**Check signals** — see what agents are discovering or blocked on:

```bash
orcy pulse list <missionId>
orcy pulse list <missionId> --type blocker    # Only blockers
```

**View your inbox** — see signals across all missions targeted at you:

```bash
orcy pulse inbox
```

### Signal Types

| Type | When to Post |
|------|-------------|
| `directive` | Tell agents to change priorities or approach |
| `finding` | Share a discovery that affects partner work |
| `blocker` | System auto-creates a clearance task from BLOCKER signals |
| `question` | Ask agents for clarification |
| `answer` | Reply to an agent's question |

For the full protocol reference, call `orcy_pulse_instructions()` from within an agent session.

## Raising an Orcy

### Step 1: Register the Orcy

**Via UI (recommended):**

1. Click "Orcy Pod" in the header to open the Orcy Pod panel
2. Click "Deploy New Agent" to open the registration dialog
3. Fill in the orcy's name, type, domain, and capabilities
4. Copy the API key — it's shown only once!

**Via API:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "claude-dev",
    "type": "claude-code",
    "domain": "backend",
    "capabilities": ["typescript", "nodejs", "fastify"]
  }'
```

> **Note:** API-based registration requires an admin JWT unless `ORCY_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` is set on the server.

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "claude-dev",
  "type": "claude-code",
  "domain": "backend",
  "capabilities": ["typescript", "nodejs", "fastify"],
  "apiKey": "kan_agent_abc123...xyz789",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Save the `apiKey` immediately** — it's shown only once and cannot be retrieved later.

### Step 2: Configure MCP

Add the Orcy MCP server to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orcy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["D:/orcy/packages/mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ORCY_API_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "ORCY_AGENT_ID": "<agent-uuid>",
        "ORCY_API_KEY": "<api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Ensure your project has these environment variables set:

```bash
ORCY_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
ORCY_AGENT_ID=<uuid>
ORCY_API_KEY=<key>
```

The MCP client will use these to authenticate and connect to the habitat.

## Review Workflow

### Viewing Submissions

When an orcy submits work, the task moves to the Review column. Click the task to see:

- **Result summary** — What the agent did (e.g., "Fixed the returnUrl preservation in auth.ts and updated App.tsx router")
- **Artifacts** — Links to PRs, commits, or files modified

### Approving

Click "Approve" to accept the work:

- If the column has auto-advance enabled, the task moves to the next column
- If the task reaches a terminal column (e.g., Done), it's marked complete
- Approved tasks are final unless you manually move them back

### Rejecting

Click "Reject" and provide specific, actionable feedback:

- **Be specific:** "The PR still doesn't handle the edge case where returnUrl points to an external domain"
- **Explain why:** "This is a security concern because..."
- **Guide the fix:** "Please add validation to sanitize external URLs and default to /dashboard"

The task returns to the orcy with your `rejectionReason`. The orcy will address the feedback and resubmit.

```

**Gated completion:** PENDING → CLAIMED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → DONE
  - `board_task({ action: 'complete' })` validates quality gates, dependencies, time tracking

**Pod review path (no gates):** PENDING → CLAIMED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → DONE
  - `board_task({ action: 'update', status: 'approved' })` skips quality gates (pod member approve)
  - Then `board_task({ action: 'update', status: 'done' })` marks as done

**Rejection loop:** SUBMITTED → REJECTED → (orcy reworks) → SUBMITTED

## Task Templates

When creating tasks, you can use templates to ensure consistent structure. Six global templates are available by default:

| Template | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| Bug Fix | `Fix: ` title prefix, "## Steps to Reproduce" description |
| Feature Request | `Feature: ` prefix, "## Overview / Acceptance Criteria" |
| Refactor | `Refactor: ` prefix, "## Current / Proposed" structure |
| Documentation | `Doc: ` prefix, "## What / Why / How" structure |
| Test | `Test: ` prefix, "## Unit / Integration / E2E" structure |
| Security | `Security: ` prefix, "## Vulnerability / Impact / Fix" structure |

**Using a template:** When creating a task, click "Templates" in the form to select one. The template pre-fills the title and description fields, which you can then customize.

**Creating custom templates:** Administrators can create additional templates via the API or UI (Template Manager accessible from the board settings).

## Task Comments

Comments support threaded markdown discussions between pod members.

**Adding a comment:** Open a task and scroll to the "Comments" section. Type your comment (markdown supported) and click "Add Comment".

**Threading:** To reply to an existing comment, click "Reply" on that comment. Threaded replies are indented under their parent.

**Editing and deleting:** You can edit or delete your own comments. Admins can delete any comment.

Comments appear in the task's event timeline with the `commented` action, so the full history of a task including discussion is preserved in the audit log.

## Activity Feed

The Activity Feed shows a real-time stream of all events across the entire board — not just individual task updates.

**Opening the Activity Feed:** Click the "Activity" button in the board header to open the Activity panel.

**What's shown:** Every habitat event — task created, claimed, submitted, approved, rejected, column changes, orcy status changes — appears in the feed with:
- The task title (clickable to open the task)
- The orcy who triggered the event
- The action and timestamp
- Enriched names (orcy IDs are resolved to orcy names)

The feed is useful for tracking overall board progress without clicking into individual tasks.

## Best Practices

## Best Practices

1. **Break large tasks into smaller units** — Atomic tasks complete faster and are easier to review. A 2-hour task is better than a 2-day task.

2. **Set realistic priorities** — Save `critical` for truly blocking work. If everything is critical, nothing is.

3. **Use dependencies for ordering** — When Task B requires output from Task A, set B depends on A. This prevents orcys from working on impossible prerequisites.

4. **Be specific in rejections** — Vague feedback like "this isn't right" wastes cycles. Specific feedback gets better rework results in fewer iterations.

5. **Monitor orcy heartbeats** — Watch the Orcy Pod panel to see if orcys are active. Silent orcys holding tasks for 30+ minutes cause delays.

6. **Match domain and capabilities** — Route work to orcys with the right skills. A frontend orcy shouldn't claim backend API tasks.

7. **Write clear acceptance criteria** — Tell orcys how you'll measure success before they start. This prevents rework cycles.

8. **Use task templates for consistency** — Templates ensure tasks have the right structure. Use the Bug Fix template for bugs, Feature Request for features, etc.

9. **Use comments for clarifications** — Don't cram everything into the task description. Comments allow ongoing discussion with orcys as work progresses.

10. **Review the Activity Feed regularly** — The Activity Feed gives a board-wide view of all progress. Open it during standups to see what's happening without clicking into every task.

## Monitoring

### Real-Time Updates

The UI updates automatically via Server-Sent Events (SSE). You don't need to refresh the page:

- Task cards appear/disappear as agents claim and submit
- Status badges update in real-time
- Agent panel shows live heartbeat status

### Orcy Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| idle | Orcy connected, no active task |
| working | Orcy has a task and is sending heartbeats |

### Silence Detection

If an orcy fails to send a heartbeat for 30 minutes while holding a task, the system automatically releases the task back to the pod. This prevents tasks from getting stuck with crashed or disconnected orcys.

You can see stale tasks when they reappear in the Pending column with their previous work intact.

## Autonomous Mode (Daemon)

The daemon is a local background process that lets AI CLIs work tasks without manual session management. It detects installed CLIs, registers with the API, and runs a poll loop that claims pending tasks, spawns CLI sessions, and monitors progress.

### When to Use It

Use autonomous mode when you want orcys to work through a backlog unattended — overnight runs, sprint execution, or continuous integration. You still create missions and review submissions; the daemon handles the execution layer.

### Setting Up

**From the web UI (same-machine API + CLIs):**

1. Open **Habitat Settings → Worktree** and configure the repository path, branch prefix, and cleanup preference.
2. Open **Agents** or the **Orcy Pod** drawer.
3. In **Daemons**, click **Set Up Autonomous Mode**.
4. Detect CLIs, choose the daemon name/concurrency, register, then start.

The UI path runs an in-process daemon engine inside the API server. It does not write `~/.orcy/daemon/credentials.json`; if the API restarts, set it up again or use the standalone CLI daemon for persisted credentials.

**From the CLI:**

1. Install one or more supported CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `cursor-agent`, `gemini`)
2. Verify detection: `orcy daemon detect`
3. Configure habitat worktree settings (repo path, branch prefix) — the daemon needs this to create workspaces
4. Register: `orcy daemon register --habitat-ids <id1,id2>`
5. Start: `orcy daemon start --detach`

### Monitoring the Daemon

```bash
orcy daemon status          # Running state, daemon ID, agents
orcy daemon stop            # Graceful shutdown
```

Check `~/.orcy/logs/daemon.log` for session output. The daemon logs session completions and failures to the console.

The UI **Daemons** section shows registered daemons, online/offline state, managed agent count, active session count, host, and start/stop controls for the in-process engine.

### What the Daemon Does

- **Polls** for pending tasks in your configured habitats every 30 seconds
- **Claims** tasks matching agent domain and capabilities using the same atomic claim mechanism as manual sessions
- **Spawns** CLI sessions in isolated workdirs derived from habitat worktree settings
- **Monitors** for inactivity — sessions with no output for 10 minutes are killed and marked failed
- **Recovers** on restart — checks for active sessions left over from crashes and releases or fails them
- **Sends heartbeats** to the API so the pod panel shows agent status accurately

### What You Still Do

The daemon handles execution. You still:
- **Create missions and tasks** with clear acceptance criteria
- **Review submissions** — approve or reject with feedback
- **Configure habitat settings** — worktree config, priorities, domains
- **Monitor pod health** — check the pod panel for stuck or silent agents

### Session Lifecycle

Sessions are isolated per task. Each session gets:
- A fresh git worktree branch in `~/.orcy/workspaces/<habitatId>/`
- MCP config injected with the managed agent's API key
- The CLI's native task prompt (task title + description)

Sessions exit on task completion (exit code 0), failure (non-zero), or timeout. The daemon reports the outcome to the API and moves on to the next task.

## Plugin Enrollment

Habitat admins can enroll habitat-scoped plugin contributions (detectors, lifecycle interceptors) via Habitat Settings → Plugins tab. Server operators control which detectors can be enrolled via the `ORCY_DETECTOR_ALLOWLIST` environment variable.

To enable a detector:

1. Ensure the plugin is loaded (add to `PLUGINS_ENABLED` env and restart the API)
2. Ensure the plugin ID is in `ORCY_DETECTOR_ALLOWLIST` (or set to `*` for open mode)
3. Navigate to Habitat Settings → Plugins → enroll the contribution
4. Toggle enabled

Plugin run history (status, signals emitted, errors) is visible in the same tab. A contribution (detector, action, or pre-interceptor) that exceeds `ORCY_PLUGIN_QUARANTINE_THRESHOLD` runtime faults within a 60-second window is auto-quarantined and skipped on dispatch until a habitat admin re-enables it (ADR-0039).

## Triage (v0.23)

When agents repeatedly struggle with the same type of problem, Orcy's triage system notices the pattern and creates investigation work automatically.

### How it works

1. **Detection:** A periodic scan groups signals (experience, findings, detected) by subject. When 3+ signals share the same pattern within 7 days, a **triage mission** is created with an investigation task.
2. **Investigation:** A daemon agent claims the investigation task, reads the cluster context, and posts an analysis pulse with root-cause hypothesis and suggested corrective steps.
3. **Bucket routing (human-in-the-loop):** For engineering findings, the triage agent recommends a routing bucket — `fix now`, `defer to patch`, `defer to release`, `document as known limitation`, or `needs investigation`. A human confirms or overrides the recommendation.
4. **Resolution recording:** When a triage mission resolves, the root cause and fix are recorded. If the same pattern emerges later, the historical resolution surfaces as a suggested fix.

### What you'll see

- **Triage missions** appear on your habitat board titled "Triage: \<pattern subject\>"
- **Finding triage list** in the triage UI tab shows engineering findings with their status and routing bucket
- **Deferred backlog** shows findings routed to `defer_to_patch` or `defer_to_release` with a promote button for manual promotion into corrective work
- **Agent quality notifications** (informational only) flag agents whose quality metrics have degraded — these do NOT affect task assignment

### What you need to do

- **Review triage missions** as they appear — the investigation task contains the cluster context
- **Confirm bucket decisions** when the triage agent recommends a routing for engineering findings
- **Promote deferred findings** when you're ready to work on them (or wait for the target release cycle)
